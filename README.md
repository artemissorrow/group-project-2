- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Have a polished UI.

## Description:
The goal was to build an app that would allow users to keep track of movies. Movies they've watch, that they haven't watched, that friends have recommended, that are their favorites, or that they think are the worst. Users would be able to sign up for an account and create their list, search for movies and save them to their list of choice.

## Under the Hood:
(description of stuff used goes here)

- [Handlebars.js]("https://handlebarsjs.com/") was used for templating, making it easy to insert data into pages to load users' personal lists and do neat stuff like greet them by name on the dashboard. Partials were a great tool for filling in lists and making a template for displaying individual movie info.
